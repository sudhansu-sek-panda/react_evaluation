1. What is the difference between id and class attributes?  
The id and class attributes in HTML both provide ways to style elements and target them with JavaScript, but they serve different purposes and have distinct rules:

id Attribute:
Uniqueness: The value of the id attribute must be unique within a document. No two elements should have the same id.

Specificity: id selectors have higher specificity in CSS. This means they override class selectors if both are applied to the same element.

JavaScript: IDs are often used to target elements directly with JavaScript. For example, you can use document.getElementById('myId') to get the element with that specific id.

Syntax: In CSS, you target an element with an id using the hash (#) symbol. For example:

css
#myId {
    color: blue;
}

class Attribute:
Reusability: The class attribute allows you to apply the same styling or behavior to multiple elements. Multiple elements can share the same class name.

Specificity: Class selectors have lower specificity compared to id selectors. They can be overridden by id selectors and other more specific selectors.

JavaScript: Classes can be used to target multiple elements in JavaScript. For example, you can use document.getElementsByClassName('myClass') or document.querySelectorAll('.myClass') to get all elements with that class.

Syntax: In CSS, you target elements with a class using the dot (.) symbol. For example:

css
.myClass {
    color: red;
}
